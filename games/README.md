## Games

Each game should have a directory containing the following:

* a `gamedata` folder containing the ALD files, etc.
* a desktop file named `<game>.desktop`
* an icon named `<game>.png`
* a script named `AppRun` to launch the game

`gamedata` directories will be downloaded automatically if they do not exist.
